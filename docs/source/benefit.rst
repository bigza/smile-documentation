The Benefits of SMILE 
=====

1.  **Informs policy and decision-making for immunization supply chain management at all levels**

    Vaccine managers at the city and provincial levels can view every transaction (receipt and distribution of vaccines) made by Puskesmas staff. Ideally, the number of transactions is directly proportional to the number of Posyandu, schools, and health services/private practices which are the vaccine distribution points. Transactions will rise during an epidemic and the BIAS period

2.  **Develops standard operating procedures for systematic record-keeping of vaccine logistics in order to minimize human error in recording**

    The Puskesmas frequently cross-checks their records with the existing vaccination supply, and SMILE shows that the number of inaccurate data is decreasing. This demonstrates that the SMILE application has benefited Puskesmas officers in minimizing mistakes in selecting and recording the vaccine supply to be utilized (complete with batch, Expiry Date, and VVM status), as well as calculating the remaining supply because the application is fully automated. As a result, there is no longer a discrepancy between supply records and physical ones.

3.  **Facilitates maintenance of optimum vaccine stocks by reducing instances of vaccine wastage and stock-out**

    Out-of-stock events are something that should never happen, but can't be avoided if there is negligence by the Puskesmas staff in maintaining the health center stock, and the delay in the arrival of vaccine supplies from the Health Office.

    The Puskesmas staff's carelessness in preserving the stock owned by the Puskesmas can be reduced with SMILE since SMILE constantly reminds the Officers of the stock they have. SMILE will show the materials possessed before and after the vaccination is issued by Puskesmas staff. Officers are immediately notified when a red color emerges on the application, indicating that the vaccine stock is running low, or when a yellow color shows, indicating that the vaccine stock is on the approach of being emptied.

    SMILE uses the SMS feature as a warning to officers when the vaccine runs out and is at the minimum threshold. The SMILE application may dramatically minimize the incidence of out-of-stock at the Puskesmas with high sensitivity, even in seconds. Out-of-stock occurrences may be traced back to a certain time, Puskesmas/Health Office location, and vaccination type.

4.  **Supervision and Minimization of Excess Vaccine Stock**

    It is also crucial to avoid excess vaccine stock to maintain the quality of the vaccine during storage in the refrigerator. Good planning is the main requirement so that demand and fulfillment of demand, approach real needs. Transparency of information about vaccine usage in that month allows accurate monitoring and calculation by the Health Office and Puskesmas for the allocation of vaccines in the following month.

5.  **Ensures quality and safety of vaccines through real-time information on storage temperature with the help of SIM-enabled temperature loggers**

    Vaccines are frequently damaged as a result of officer delays in handling when the temperature of the refrigerator rises/falls due to power failures, refrigerator malfunction, and so forth. SMILE monitors the refrigerator temperature 24 hours a day, seven days a week by installing a temperature sensor inside the refrigerator that can transmit signals to the application at relatively short intervals (every 10 minutes).

    SMILE logging is more sensitive and accurate than manual logging. Alerts via SMS from the application to Puskesmas staff whenever an extreme storage temperature occurs, have helped officers to immediately take steps to protect the vaccine, such as resetting the refrigerator thermostat, or moving the vaccine to a cool box or temporary refrigerator until the refrigerator temperature returns to normal.

6.  **Improves efficiency of vaccine cold chain logistics management by introduction of state-of-the-art technology for digitizing vaccine stocks**

    The innovations developed in the SMILE application include big data technologies. The SMILE application can handle up to 10,000 users from all health facilities in Indonesia concurrently and in real-time. We also use tools for data visualization and business intelligence for reporting needed by the health office in the smile application

7.  **Strengthens the immunization system by empowering the human resources in districts.**

    In order to ensure that distribution of vaccines runs smoothly, SMILE provides e-learning material and intensive training to develop vaccine cold chain handlers at district health offices for constant support to estimate vaccine requirements and provide supportive supervision.

With the development of this application, it is hoped that the coverage of immunization programs in Indonesia will increase and the mortality rate will decrease directly as the main impact of SMILE. The use of SMILE application is expected to ensure three main outcomes which are immunization logistics can be planned effectively, immunization stocks are available for all health facilities in Indonesia, and wastage rate decreased. In the end, hopefully, it will be easier for the public to get access to vaccines, faster and more accurate provision of vaccines throughout Indonesia, and reduce costs and risk of vaccine damage due to uncontrolled vaccine storage conditions.
